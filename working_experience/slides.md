## Things I have done

Note:

These are some highlights on the projects/applications I have been working over the last 20 years
as software engineer in the automotive industry.

### Automatic Control and Computer Science

5 Years Bachelor Studies

--

I have studied Automatic Control and Computer Science for 5 years at the Technical University of Iasi, Romania.
In the fifth year I was awarded a Socrates-Erasmus scholarship to study at the University of Gent, Belgium.
I finished my studies in 2005 with a final mark of 9.81 out of 10.

### Nonlinear Model Based Predictive Control of a Switched Mode DC-DC Converter

Diploma Thesis

--

My thesis focused on the implementation of a Model Based Predictive Control (MBPC)
strategy for a switched-mode DC-DC power converter (SMPC) using a Digital Signal
Processor (DSP). So, I had to learn a lot about power electronics, modeling,
control strategies and programming digital signal processors.

In addition to working on my thesis, I was also took the master courses in
`Computer Control of Industrial Processes`. I got the highest mark in the class.
