# About me

When I was born in 1981, I did not possess too many engineering skills except for curiosity and eager to learn. I have been learning for my entire life and I cannot stop.

I have learned what responsibility is at a quite tender age. I was 11 years old when my father died and I started to work over summers to support my family.

I have learned what the feature of self-sufficiency is when I finished high-school and my mother did not have money to send me to the university. I made up a simple plan: earn my own money to go to university and work hard to have a scholarship during the studies. I started to look for a job and I won a contest for a secondary school mathematics teacher position.

There were not more than three persons who believed that I would still follow my plan to go to university the next year. Of course, I did it and after the second year I was the first one in the department of “Automatic Control and Industrial Informatics” of the “Automatic Control and Computer Science” faculty of Iasi.

In faculty I have studied control theory, topics like system identification and control strategies. I have put this into practice for my diploma thesis when I engineered a “Real-Time Nonlinear Model Based Predictive Control of a DC-DC converter using a Digital Signal Processor”.

When I obtained my first job I had no idea what is a V-model, design patterns or safety critical systems development. Now, after more than fifteen years in the Automotive Industry, I can argue about the advantages and disadvantages or limitations of using the V-model during both prototyping and series development. During these years I have designed, implemented and tested components for Electronic Braking Systems, I was responsible for the software integration, managed small development teams and designed automated test environments.

Currently I develop software applications for the automotive industry and I help individuals and teams to improve their software development skills.
I am interested in engineering software product lines, software architecture and build systems.

**2005** Diploma Thesis
^^^

My thesis focused on the implementation of a Model Based Predictive Control (MBPC)
strategy for a switched-mode DC-DC power converter (SMPC) using a Digital Signal
Processor (DSP).

In addition to working on my thesis, I also followed the master courses in
**Computer Control of Industrial Processes**. I got the highest mark in the class.

**2005** Graduated from TU Iasi
^^^

I have studied **Automatic Control and Computer Science** for 5 years at the Technical University of Iasi, Romania.
In the fifth year I was awarded a Socrates-Erasmus scholarship to study at the University of Gent, Belgium.
I finished my studies with a final mark of **9.81** out of **10**.
